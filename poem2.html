        Now that the <b>sun</b> has set and the rain has abated,
And every porch <b>light</b><br><br>

          in the neighborhood is lit,
Maybe we can <b>invent</b> something; I'd like a new<br><br>

Way of experiencing the <b>world</b>, a way of taking
Into <b>myself</b> the single light shining at the center<br><br>

Of all things without losing the dense, eccentric
<b>Planets</b> orbiting around it.<br><br>

          What you'd like is a more
Attentive <b>lover</b>, I suppose—· Too bad that slow,<br><br>

Wet scorch of orange blossoms <b>floating</b> towards
The storm drain is not a <b>vein</b> of stars . . . we could<br><br>

Make a wish on one of them; not that we would
Wish for anything but the <b>impossible</b><br><br>
