    <p>
        Now that the sun has set and the rain has abated,
And every porch light<br><br>

          in the neighborhood is lit,
Maybe we can invent something; I'd like a new<br><br>

Way of experiencing the world, a way of taking
Into myself the single light shining at the center<br><br>

Of all things without losing the dense, eccentric
Planets orbiting around it.<br><br>

          What you'd like is a more
Attentive lover, I suppose—· Too bad that slow,<br><br>

Wet scorch of orange blossoms floating towards
The storm drain is not a vein of stars . . . we could<br><br>

Make a wish on one of them; not that we would
Wish for anything but the impossible.<br><br>
